## Introduction
 Welcome to the [DARA Big Data](https://www.darabigdata.com) project Agri Hack! This hackathon was first run at the University of Fort Hare in South Africa <img src="https://github.com/darabigdata/AgriHack1/blob/master/media/animated-south-african-flag-2.gif" width=5%>

The DARA Big Data hackathon is designed to help you improve your data science skills in a friendly and supportive environment. At the hackathon, you will be grouped into **teams of four** and each team will work independently on the hack challenge. At the end of the hack each team will give a 5 minute (3 slide) presentation on the results of their challenge. These presentations will be judged by the organisers and there will be a prize for the winning team. The presentations will be judged on (1) the accuracy of the predicted results via machine learning and (2) visualisation/presentation of the data and results.

The DARA Big Data hack challenges will be run in Python3 using the [IDIA Cloud](idia.ac.za/research-and-projects/african-research-cloud). Students should have a basic working knowledge of Python (including the scipy and numpy libraries) - but you do not have to be an expert to take part and enjoy yourself!

### Not at the hackathon, but want to test your code-building skills? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/darabigdata/AgriHack1.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. They can all be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/darabigdata/AgriHack1/blob/master/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### New to Github?

The easiest way to get all of the lecture and tutorial material is to clone this repository. To do this you need git installed on your laptop. If you're working on Linux you can install git using apt-get (you might need to use sudo):

```
apt install git
```

You can then clone the repository by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/darabigdata/AgriHack1.git
```

To update your clone if changes are made, use:

```
cd AgriHack1/
git pull
```
