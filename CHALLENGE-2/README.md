Welcome to the [Ilifu](http://www.ilifu.ac.za/) - [IDIA](https://www.idia.ac.za/) Hack! This Agricutlure-related project was created by [DARA Big Data](https://www.darabigdata.com). 


# Challenge 2: Estimate the amount of flood damage after a hurricane

In this challenge you will use radar data provided by the European Space Agency [Sentinel](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions) Mission to identify flooded regions in Puerto Rico and Mozambique. There are three tutorials available in which you will learn about how to handle and process images, as well as how to use k-means clustering to develop a solution to the task at hand.

### Not at the hackathon, but want to test your code-building skills? Feel free!

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/darabigdata/AgriHack1.git
```

Then make sure you have the right Python libraries for the tutorials. They can all be installed using pip and the [requirements.txt](https://github.com/darabigdata/AgriHack1/blob/master/requirements.txt) file in the repo:

```bash
> pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### New to Github?

The easiest way to get all of the lecture and tutorial material is to clone this repository. To do this you need git installed on your laptop. If you're working on Linux you can install git using apt-get (you might need to use sudo):

```
apt install git
```

You can then clone the repository by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/darabigdata/AgriHack1.git
```

To update your clone if changes are made, use:

```
cd AgriHack1/
git pull
```
