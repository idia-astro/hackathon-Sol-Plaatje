Welcome to the [Ilifu](http://www.ilifu.ac.za/) - [IDIA](https://www.idia.ac.za/) Hack at Sol Plaatjie University! The hackathon is designed to help you improve your data science skills in a friendly and supportive environment. At the hackathon, you will be grouped into **teams of four** and each team will work independently on the hack challenge. At the end of the hack each team will give a 10 minute presentation on the results of their challenge. These presentations will be judged by the organisers and there will be a prize for the winning team. The presentations will be judged on (1) the accuracy of the predicted results via machine learning and (2) visualisation/presentation of the data and results.

In this hack you will work on one of three projects: (i) CHALLENGE-1 - Build a movie recommendation App! (ii) CHALLENGE-2 - Estimate the amount of flood damage after a hurricane using satellite images! (iii) CHALLENGE-3 - Help astronomers find pulsar signals from space! All projects were created by [DARA Big Data](https://www.darabigdata.com).

The hack will be run in Python3 using the [IDIA Cloud](idia.ac.za/research-and-projects/african-research-cloud). Students should have a basic working knowledge of Python (including the scipy and numpy libraries) - but you do not have to be an expert to take part and enjoy yourself!
